When you define a route, you define a set of operations that must be performed to complete the route. Each operation is associated with one or more pieces of equipment that are defined in Plant Applications.</p><p>Using Route Management, in addition to creating an operation, you can copy, modify, and delete an operation.</p><example><title>Operations in a Motor Assembly Route</title> Suppose you want to create a route for assembling the parts of a motor. The following tasks are involved in completing the route: <ul><li>Shell turning</li><li>Stator and endshield assembling</li><li>Rotor and endshield assembling</li><li>Testing</li><li>Painting</li><li>Packaging</li></ul> For each of these tasks, you will create an operation and associate it with one or more pieces of equipment as follows. <table><tgroup cols="2"><thead><row><entry>Operation</entry><entry>Equipment</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry>Shell turning</entry><entry>The lathe machine</entry></row><row><entry>Stator and endshield assembling</entry><entry>The pneumatic bolt tightener</entry></row><row><entry>Rotor and endshield assembling</entry><entry>The pneumatic bolt tightener</entry></row><row><entry>Testing</entry><entry>
