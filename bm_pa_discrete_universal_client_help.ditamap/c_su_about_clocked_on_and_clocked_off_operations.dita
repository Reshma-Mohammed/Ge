You can also clock off an operation if an operator has stopped working on the operation intermittently, and then clock on the operation again when the operator resumes working on it. This ensures that the time taken to complete the operation excludes the clocked off time, thus resulting in a more accurate calculation. </p><p>Using this page, you can:</p><ul><li>Access a list of operations and view the operators working on these operations.</li><li>View the time when the operation is clocked on or clocked off.</li><li>Clock on or clock off an operation for the operator. </li></ul></conbody></concept>
