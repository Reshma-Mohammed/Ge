You can also view the users who worked on the operations and the time taken to complete each operation. </p><p>In the Order Management application, the <wintitle>All Serial/Lots</wintitle> pane displays the <xref href="c_su_lot_status_indicators.dita">statuses of the serial numbers</xref>, and the table in the <wintitle>Current Status</wintitle> page displays the <xref href="c_su_operation_status_indicators.dita">statuses of the operations</xref>. <note>During production, the status of a lot and an operation may differ as follows:<ul><li>When a lot is put on hold, the status of the operation associated with that lot can be In Progress. </li><li>When a lot is scrapped, the operation associated with that lot can be cancelled. </li><li>When a defect is created in an operation, the lot appears in the In Progress status until that operation, and then the lot is put on hold. For example, if a defect is created in operation 30, the lot appears in the In Progress status until operation 20; the lot is put on hold in operation 30. </li></ul></note></p></conbody></concept>
