By default, the work queue contains the operations that meet at least one of the following criteria:<ul><li>Operations assigned to you</li><li>Operations in which at least one serial number has been clocked on</li></ul></p><p>In addition, you can add an operation or all the available operations in a work order to the work queue. You can add an operation if at least one serial number is available for you to begin work.</p><p>Adding operations to the work queue has the following advantages:<ul><li>Extends the list of operations that you want to perform</li><li>Provides visibility on the progress of work that you plan to complete.</li></ul>
                                </p><p>To add operations, you can enter the serial number (on which you want to perform an operation) manually or scan the bar code. You can also enter the name of the operation or work order. </p></conbody></concept>
